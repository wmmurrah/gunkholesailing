    "text": "When I purchages Outlier she had a 2011 Tohatsu 6hp outboard motor. It took me some time to get used to running the outboard, which after I learned to open the air vent in the fuel tank (see Squall on Lake Martin) After running her with that motor for a year, I decided a tune up would be a good idea. I wanted to do it myself, to save money, and, well, that is one of the reasons I got into sailing, as an opportunity for many DIY projects.\nboats.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem_No\nOrder_Details\nQuantity\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n312722010\nSAFETY ROPE (Tohatsu)\n1\n2.85\n\n\n332600061\nGASKET (10 MULTIPLE) (Tohatsu)\n2\n1.70\n\n\n369022301\nFUEL FILTER (Tohatsu) 12.12\n1\n12.12\n\n\n369650110\nLINER, WATER PUMP CASE (Tohatsu)\n1\n5.27\n\n\n369650181\nGASKET, WATER PUMP CASE (Tohatsu)\n1\n1.83\n\n\n369650211\nIMPELLER NS3.5B/NS5B/4-6HP 4STR (Tohatsu)\n1\n19.28\n\n\n369650220\nKEY (Tohatsu)\n1\n1.49\n\n\n369650250\nGUIDE PLATE (Tohatsu)\n1\n2.89\n\n\n369650290\nGASKET, PUMP GUIDE PLATE (Tohatsu)\n1\n1.85\n\n\n3H6074060\nWASHER (Tohatsu)\n1\n1.30\n\n\n3H6602180\nANODE, ZINC (SQUARE) (Tohatsu)\n1\n5.51\n\n\n9515030318\nSPLIT PIN (10 MULTIPLE) (Tohatsu)\n1\n0.95\n\n\n\n\n\nSo with shipping and handling being $9.95 and tax at $5.13, that brought the total to $72.12.

Also, a couple of the parts I ordered have multiple items, so will likely not have to purchas again for the next several tune ups."

    "text": "Anchored on Lake Martin just west of the Smith Mountain fire tower.\nOne of the things I love about sailing that I was not expecting to enjoy so much is staying out at anchor.\nBut anchoring poses some logistical issues, a major one is how to get ashore. In the heat of summer on a calm lake, swimming ashore is feasible. And with a small boat on a lake, you can often anchor very close to shore. But I also like to sail during the colder months. This means I need some craft to act as a dinghy for Outlier. It took some time to figure out a solution."

    "section": "Lake Dinghy for Outlier",
    "text": "Lake Dinghy for Outlier\nBeing a 23 foot boat, Outlier poses a problem selecting a dinghy. Ideally, I wanted something that met the following criteria:\n\nA craft with reasonable capacity to transport multiple people as well as gear and provisions,\nsomething that could be compactly stored without impeding sailing performance,\ncould be easily deployed,\nwas reasonably inexpensive and,\nMultipurpose, meaning it could be used for recreation.\n\nMy first serious consideration was an inflatable stand-up paddleboard (ISUP). The thinking was that a longer one might be able to transport a couple of people – especially a small person like my daughter –, it could be deflated, or stored on racks outside the lifelines, and could be used for recreational purposes. But, after borrowing a couple for our first trip to the coast with Outlier, it seemed that storing outside the lifelines was not really a good option. An ISUP large enough for our purposes, would span most of the deck length. This meant that it would have to be transported deflated, and then inflated at anchor. So, either I had to spend about 20 minutes of vigorous exercise to inflate each one (we were considering getting two), or provide power for an electric pump. Because Outlier has an outboard motor and no alternator, plus only one house battery, this was an issue. A good quality ISUP was also over $1,000. Any craft that required inflation was thus not a good choice for our circumstances.\nThis left either a very small craft that could fit on deck or one that could be folded. I did not see any way to fit a craft on our small deck, which left us looking for a folding craft. I had seen folding dinghies, such as the port-a-bote, but these are very expensive, and still take up considerable space on a boat the size of Outlier.\n\n\n\nOru Lake at the lake\n\n\nI eventually settled on an Oru Lake folding kayak. This craft folded to a reasonable size, was light, could be deployed in a few minutes without requiring vigorous effort or electricity, could be used recreationally, and was less expensive than the other options I’d considered. But, while it could transport some gear, and I did get my daughter and myself across a small body of water in the kayak, it is not feasible to transport multiple adults at the same time. My solution is to carry a long piece of small diameter retrieval line, so individuals can row ashore, the kayak can be pulled back to the boat, and another adult could row ashore. This requires being somewhat close to shore, but this is very common on the lake. Not surprisingly, this is not an ideal solution, as is often heard, sailing is all about compromises, and this is what I settled on."

    "text": "Lake Martin (Young’s Island and Dare Park), March 24-25\nI had planned two nights on the lake. I got to the marina early Friday evening, splashed, rigged, and stocked Outlier and was planning on staying at the dock that night. Insetad, I decided to go out and watch the sunset, maybe returning, maybe staying out at anchor. Eventually, I decided to stay out and sailed over to Wood’s Island looking at the small cove on the southeast of the island just behind the beach area. The trees protecting this cove from a southern wind seemed too little for adequate protection, so I made my way across to Young’s Island. I left the Mantis II anchor sitting on the foredeck, and not surprisingly, it fell into the water on the way over. I turned into the wind, recovered the anchor, which, forehandedly, I did secure the other end of the rode to the boat, then continued over to the cove on the southwestern side of Young’s Island.\nI expected rain early Saturday morning – predictions were for about 6am. I was anchored in the big cove on the southeast part of Young’s Island, which is protected from the north east and south, but no the east. The winds were predicted to be from the south/southeast all weekend. Early Saturday morning a fairly strong storm blew in and the wind clocked from south to directly east. I realized this, when after closing the v-berth hatch about 4am due to light rain, just before 6am I was awakened by outlier swinging 180 degrees in about 3 seconds. Now instead of being a out 150 feet off shore I was about 40 feet from a lee shore, with winds increasing. the 180 degrees swing meant the anchor was likely to reset, and I had little room for that to happen. I put on my “foulies” (i.e. my rain jacket. I’ve got to get some more rain pants), and waited in the companion way only able to see the shore during lightning flashes for the first 10-20 minutes of the squall. Of course my anus was very puckered during this time: if I did start dragging, I would have to jump out and hope the outboard would crank, AND be able to push Outlier with the tarp up (windage) against 20-25 knot winds. Turns out the Mantis II held like a tank. Best money I’ve spent on this boat. And it was in there. I had to back the boat of the anchor in the other direction. I couldn’t dislodge it by hand. My only regret: I didn’t film it. What?! I’ve got to start filming these things. All and all, I learned lot’s and feel this year each time I go out several things start to “click”."

And I will gladly admit that most of the channels I follow fit into that category; I too have the dream of a life aboard a bluewater sailboat. Alas, this is not likely for me, at least not yet, and frankly I’m not sure I would really want to do that at this stage in my life. For one, I have a family and, let’s just say, they are not nearly as into sailing as I am. Also, I have a job, and enjoy having things like money and health insurance.\nBut who says you can’t have your cake and eat it too? Why not do both? This website chronicles a different kind of sailor. More of a weekend warrior. It collects my experiences learning to sail a small, trailerable sailboat, mostly in a lake near my home, but also in other fairly protected waters. You won’t see epic voyages across oceans on this site, but adventure is were you find. And there are some very adventuresome things you can do with a small sailboat.\nI suspect there are others who dream of a life at sea following the wind, but are not ready or willing to give up their “regular” life. If this site helps you strike a compromise then it’s served its purpose.\n\nHow to Find Stuff on gunkholesailing.com\nThere are at least 3 ways to find stuff on this site. First, the navigation bar at the top organized information by categories.\n\nOutlier - Contains information about my sailboat.\nGunkhole Seamanship - Contains information about skills needed for sailing and maintaining a small (under 25’), shoal draft sailboat.\nGunktube - While videos are linked throughout the website, this tab houses links to all of them in chronological order along with descriptions of their content.\nBluewater Dreaming - Contains information about the various boats I dream of owning one day. My “ideal” dream boat changes often.\n\nSecond, the Captain’s Log on the left of the home page contains a chronological list, with links to other content on the website. While the other tabs are organized conceptually, this tab is there if people are interested in how my journey has progressed over time.\nFinally, in the top right of the navigation bar is a magnifying glass that most will recognize as a link to a search bar that can be used to search for content with search terms."
