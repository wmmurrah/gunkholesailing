>"To be forehanded is to be cautious and even pessimistic. A forehanded sailor looks ahead, anticipates the worst, and prepares for it by, among other things, setting and observing standard operating procedures."  
                        - John Rousmanere[^1]
  
The title of this website is much more of an aspiration than assertion.
The goal of the site is to document my journey to try to become a forehanded sailor.

The initial purpose of this site is as a repository for the information to document what I have done to become a sailor, and to help me plan future projects and adventures.
I hope it might also be helpful to others.

### How to Find Stuff

There are at least 3 ways to find stuff on this site.
First, the navigation bar at the top organized information by categories.

* **Outlier** - Contains information about my first (and currently only) sailboat.

* **Dream Boat(s)** - Contains information about the various boats I dream of owning one day. My "ideal" dream boat changes often.

* **Seamanship** - Contains information about skills needed for sailing and maintaining a sailboat.

* **Videos** - While videos are linked throughout the website, this tab houses links to all of them in chronological order.

Second, the **Captain's Log** on the left of the home page contains a chronological list, with links to other content on the website. While the other tabs are organized conceptually, this tab is there if people are interested in how my journey has progressed over time.

Finally, in the top right of the navigation bar is a magnifying glass that most will recognize as a link to a search bar that can be used to search for content with search terms.
