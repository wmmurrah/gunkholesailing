title: "About Outlier"

*Outlier* is a 1990 [Precision 23](http://www.precisionboatworks.com/boats/p23/index.php) that I purchased in December of 2021.
She is my first sailboat, which I purchased with no prior experience sailing.

In statistics, an outlier is a data point that lies far away from the other data points. It's a deviant, that challenges basic assumptions, and begs explanation. That describes the purpose of my boat.
