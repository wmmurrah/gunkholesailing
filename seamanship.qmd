>"To be forehanded is to be cautious and even pessimistic. A forehanded sailor looks ahead, anticipates the worst, and prepares for it by, among other things, setting and observing standard operating procedures."  
                        - John Rousmanere[^1]
  
The title of this section is much more of an aspiration than assertion.
The goal of th is to document my journey to try to become a forehanded sailor.

The initial purpose of this site is as a repository for the information to document what I have done to become a sailor, and to help me plan future projects and adventures.
I hope it might also be helpful to others.
